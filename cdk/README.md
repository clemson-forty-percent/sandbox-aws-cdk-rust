# Sandbox: AWS CDK + Rust

A short experiment on applying CDK with Rust. Did once before in a private repo, now redoing the work to practice with a CI/CD workflow created in AWS.

I'm listening to NoteBlock's ["Train Rush" A Hat in Time Remix](https://noteblock.bandcamp.com/track/train-rush-a-hat-in-time-remix) on repeat while building this. It's so good.
